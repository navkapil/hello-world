## Oppurtunities with us
If you are willing in working in the area of Machine Learning or Wireless Sensor Networks you are welcome for PhD with our group.

We believe in longer and strong interaction with students so as to come up with right research directions. This needs a whole lot of work and prepartion at both ends. Therefore, an **internship oppurtunity** is an obvious choice which give students more confidence in the area they would like to research. _You can contact us at_ 'kapil[at]nitkkr.ac.in'
